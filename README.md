idea taken from @inotflying (https://github.com/inotflying/mcbe-new-play-screen-disabler),
but i automated and a bit improved his program

ps: You MUST have minecraft installed NOT in windows folder, basicaly you can use jiayi, bedrock launcher or some other version switchers
reason: you cant patch anything in system folder(( i mean u prob can but program will be detected as virus
